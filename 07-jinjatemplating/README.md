# Jinja2

https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/api/#basics

jinja2 is my go-to for templating, particularly html documents, but really, it's a templating system and you can do whatever you want with it.

This little example shows in step 1, how to turn your data and a prepared template into "rendered" htmls and in step 2, how to extend a base template, to encapsulate that complexity to somewhere else.
