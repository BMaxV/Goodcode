# testing

testing is about verifying that the code that was written does what was intended.

On the list in the main readme that's pretty high up, it's really important.

So important that it was covered in many many places and is the subject of such jokes as:

"
QA walks into a bar, orders -1 beer, orders 4.5 beer, orders 999999999 beer

customer walks into a bar, asks where the bathroom is, bar explodes
"

So it's "well known", why cover it here? The joke above is about confusing the primary function of testing with secondary functions bars provide.

Testing libraries and other sources can confuse in the same way, or simply omit parts, because the topic is so large.

This example uses pytest and pytest coverage and goes through every step, bit by bit, explaining why or what each test is important for, and where weaknesses can creep up. Like in the joke.
